### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Total Contract Value Analyzed: $1.8 Billion
This comprehensive analysis examines NYC's OMWBE contracting ecosystem, revealing both significant achievements and critical disparities that demand immediate action.

### Critical Findings

* Severe Demographic Disparity: Asian American contractors receive $907.3M (50.3%) while Native American contractors receive only $0.1M (0.006%) - a 900,000% gap

* Budget Execution Crisis: 57.4% of contracts awarded in Q4, creating rushed procurement and disadvantaging smaller contractors

* Subcontracting Trap: 82.3% of M/WBE contractors locked in subcontractor status, with only 24.89% sub-to-prime ratio (below 30% federal goal)

* Agency Concentration: Top 5 agencies control 75% of contract value, with DDC alone accounting for 45.8% ($824M)
