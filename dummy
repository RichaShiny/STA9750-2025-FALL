# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This project dives headfirst into Netflix’s Top 10 datasets, because if the world’s binge habits are telling a story, we’re here to translate it. Stepping into the shoes of a Netflix PR analyst, the mission was simple: uncover the hits, the hidden gems, and the global obsessions that keep viewers glued to their screens.

Armed with R and a healthy dose of curiosity, we scrubbed, polished, and explored both global and country-level data to separate signal from streaming noise. Missing values got a reality check, timestamps were tamed, and interactive tables turned raw numbers into binge-worthy insights. From the non-English underdogs dominating global charts to the TV shows with marathon top-spot runs and record-breaking debuts, we pulled the kind of stats that could headline Netflix’s next big press release.

# TASK 1: DATA ACQUISITION
# ACQUIRE DATA
```{r}
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))){
    dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv", 
                  destfile=GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
    download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv", 
                  destfile=COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}
```
